= Uploading a pipeline version

[role='_abstract']
You can upload a YAML file to an active pipeline server that contains the latest version of your pipeline. This file consists of a Kubeflow pipeline compiled using the KubeFlow Pipelines compiler. After you upload a pipeline version to a pipeline server, you can execute it by creating a pipeline run.

.Prerequisites
* You have installed the OpenShift Pipelines operator.
* You have logged in to {productname-long}.

* If you are using specialized {productname-short} groups, you are part of the user group or admin group (for example, {oai-user-group} or {oai-admin-group} ) in OpenShift.
endif::[]
