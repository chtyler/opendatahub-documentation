= About KServe deployment modes

Kserve supports two types of deployment modes: Serverless and Raw deployment. There are both advantages and disadvantages to using each of these deployment modes:

== Serverless mode

Advantages:

* Enables autoscaling based on request volume: 
** Resources scale up automatically when receiving incoming requests.
** Optimizes resource usage and maintains performance during peak times.

* Supports scale down to and from zero using Knative:
** Allows resources to scale down completely when there are no incoming requests.
** Saves costs by not running idle resources.

Disadvantages:

* Has customization limitations: 
** Serverless is limited to Knative, such as when mounting multiple volumes.

* Dependency on Knative for scaling: 
** Introduces additional complexity in setup and management compared to traditional scaling methods.

== Raw deployment mode

Advantages:

* Enables deployment with Kubernetes resources, such as Deployment, Service, Ingress, and Horizontal Pod Autoscaler: 
** Provides full control over Kubernetes resources, allowing for detailed customization and configuration of deployment settings.

* Unlocks Knative limitations, such as mounting multiple volumes. 
** Overcomes specific restrictions of Knative. 
** Beneficial for applications requiring complex configurations or multiple storage mounts.

Disadvantages:

* Does not support automatic scaling:
** Does not support automatic scaling down to zero resources when idle.
** Might result in higher costs during periods of low traffic.

* Requires manual management of scaling.
