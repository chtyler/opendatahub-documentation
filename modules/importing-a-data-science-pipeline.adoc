= Importing a data science pipeline

[role='_abstract']
To help you begin working with data science pipelines in {productname-short}, you can import a YAML file containing your pipeline's code to an active pipeline server. This file contains a Kubeflow pipeline compiled with the KubeFlow Pipelines compiler. After you have imported the pipeline to a pipeline server, you can execute the pipeline by creating a pipeline run.

.Prerequisites
* You have installed the OpenShift Pipelines operator.
* You have logged in to {productname-long}.
ifndef::upstream[]
* If you are using specialized {productname-short} groups, you are part of the user group or admin group (for example, {oai-user-group} or {oai-admin-group} ) in OpenShift.
endif::[]
ifdef::upstream[]
* If you are using specialized {productname-short} groups, you are part of the user group or admin group (for example, {odh-user-group} or {odh-admin-group}) in OpenShift.
endif::[]
* You have previously created a data science project that is available and contains a configured pipeline server.

.Procedure
. From the {productname-short} dashboard, click *Data Science Pipelines* -> *Pipelines*.
+
The *Pipelines* page opens.
. From the *Project* list, select the project that you want to import a pipeline to.
. Click *Import pipeline*.
+
The *Import pipeline* dialog opens.
. Enter the details for the pipeline that you are importing.
.. In the *Pipeline name* field, enter a name for the pipeline that you are importing.
.. In the *Pipeline description* field, enter a description for the pipeline that you are importing.
.. Click *Upload*. Alternatively, drag the file from your local machine's file system and drop it in the designated area in the *Import pipeline* dialog.
+
A file browser opens.
.. Navigate to the file containing the pipeline code and click *Select*.
.. Click *Import pipeline*.

.Verification
* The pipeline that you imported is displayed on the *Pipelines* page.
